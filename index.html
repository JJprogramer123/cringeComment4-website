                <h4>6.What the author response and why?</h4>
                <p>-Never become a arrogant cringe person and never comment 
                about cringe comment because this can cause hate 
                response by strangers and your account will be ban 
                if your cringe comment became popular. I recommend 
                to not comment about opinion and don't use 
                gadget too much.</p>
